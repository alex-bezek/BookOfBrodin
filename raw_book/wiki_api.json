With sword and shield he vanquished his foe, killed the men, and lay with women. In later episodes such as\u00a0The Terminator, he demonstrated how hard it is to kill the swole of body and mind.

It is said that this agent, known by some as the anti-Lift, was responsible for the downfall of the Brophets' John Lifts, Brohammad, Brozekiel, Bronald Schwarzenegger and many others. After deciphering the swoley texts, I have come to the conclusion that this agent is back again, disguised as a movement. The followers of Brocki have unleashed their abomination upon the world; known as CrossFit, the agents of Brocki claim that all things cardio shall bring promise of gains. The swolley texts warn of this unswolleyness in the ten bromandates which define the absolute truths of the 7 fold path to the Swole; five of the ten bromandates warn of the false bringer of gains known as cardio. Do not fall for such cheap ploys, such as \"it's a lifestyle.\" These Brockinian agents want nothing more but to rob thy of the swolley blessings bestowed upon oneself by Brodin; therefore, erasing your spot into Brohalla.",

My hour has not yet come.\" 5 His mother said to the servants, \"Do whatever he tells you.\" 6 Now six stone jugs were standing there, for the lifter's rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. 7 Zyzz said to them, \"Fill the jars with water.\" And they filled them up to the brim. 8 He said to them, \"Now draw some out, and take it to the steward of the feast.\" So they took it. 9 When the steward of the feast tasted the water now become milk, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward of the feast called the powerlifter 10 and said to him, \"Every man serves the 2% milk first; and when men have drunk freely, then the 1% milk; but you have kept the whole milk until now.\" 11 This, the first of his signs, Zyzz did at Cana in Galilift, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him. 12 After this he went down to Caper'na-um, with his mother and his bros and his lifters; and there they stayed for a few days.",

The name of the elder of these brothers was Brometheus. Brometheus was always thinking of improving and setting new PRs. He wished to spread the word of improvement to the world. Brometheus did not want to live amongst the Gods of Iron on Mount Broylmpus. He was too busy for that. The gods were spending their time lifting, but their bodies were the only swole that could be seen. Each of gods was propelled by jealousy, pettily comparing PRs like high scores on a game, wishing to inflate their ego with each rep. However, Brometheus was planning how to make the world stronger and better than it had ever been before. So instead of living on Broylmpus, Brometheus went out amongst men to live with them and help them and he quickly noticed that they were no longer happy as they had been during the golden days when Bronos, the titan, was king. He found them living by the Crossfit and cardio. They were hunted by wild beasts, and while humans had strong hearts, they could not fight back. \"If they only had Iron,\" said Brometheus to himself, \"they could at least fight the beasts and make gains; and after a while they could learn to make their own Iron and build themselves \u201cgymnasiums\u201d.\u00a0",

For if men had Iron they might become strong and wise like us, and after a while they would drive us out of our kingdom. Besides, Iron is a dangerous tool and they are too poor and ignorant to be trusted with it. It is better that we on Mount Broylmpus rule the world without threat so all can be happy.\"Brometheus didn't answer, but he had set his heart on helping mankind, and he did not give up. As he was walking by the seashore he found a sea snail. He saw that such a small soft creature, with steady determination could carry a heavy weight. He began a long journey to the top of Mount Broylmpus. \"Mankind shall have Iron, despite what Brodin has decided,\" he said to himself. And with that thought, he snuck quietly into Brodin\u2019s domain and stole two plates from Brodin\u2019s own rack. Brometheus securely strapped the plates to his back and hurried back to his own land, carrying with him the precious plates on his back. When he reached home, he called some of the thin people from their caves and built a bench and rack for them He showed them the dead lift, squat, and bench press. He showed them the food with which to make gains. Men and women gathered round the rack and were happy and filled with new strength, and thankful to Brometheus for the wonderful gift which he had brought to them.One evening, Brodin gazed down from Mount Broylmpus and noticed men and women lifting happily in every village across the land. It did not take him long to realize that Brometheus had disobeyed him and given Iron to men. Brodin was very angry and ordered that Brometheus be pinned under the mightiest of bars. And there Brometheus stayed, thinking of the future, happy in the knowledge that he had given Iron to men. After some time, men and women of the earth were strong, and they were \u2018mired across the land by man and beast alike. They decided to thank Brometheus at the heights of Brolympus. As the people ascended, they heard a most saddening noise just outside the Temple atop the mountain. It was their savior, Brometheus, held down by a bar so mighty that no man can lift it.",
