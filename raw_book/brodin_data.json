Sadly, his workout consisted of a\r    stationary bike and a few curls and lateral raises. He had also sat with no\r    shame upon the seated calf raise machine not five minutes prior.\r14 A cramp struck his calf, leaving him lying on the ground, stripped of his\r   dignity and nearly dead.\r15 Soon, a pilates instructor came near. Seeing the man lying on the ground, he\r   passed by on the other side of the path, despite hearing calls for aid.\r16 Again, a person approached, this time a member of the man's spinning class.\r   He too passed by on the other side of the path, ignoring the fallen man's\r   pleas.\r17 Then a third man approached. He was swole, his eyes alight with the fury of\r   excitement that accompanies a postworkout feeding.\r18 The man on the ground did not call out, for fear that this swole person would\r   have no pity.\r19 However, the swole man quickly rushed to the aid of his fallen bro. His\r   thumbs massaged deeply into the cramp, and from his bag he retrieved a banana\r   and a pint of whole milk.\r20 'Here, bro, potassium will help prevent cramps,' he said. When the man was\r   able to stand, the swole bro shouldered both of their gym bags and led him to\r   Chipotle.\r21 In the line, the swole bro gave the cashier a $20 and said, 'Double steak\r   burrito, and the same for my friend- but put guac on his.'\r22 In the hour that followed, the man's cramp was fully healed and he heard the\r   gospel of the truth of gains.\r23 'Now which of these men do you think was a bro to the man with the cramp?'\r   Brodin asked.\r24 'Surely it was the man who showed him mercy and bought his burrito, with\r   guac,' replied the man of weak privilege.\r25 And Brodin said, 'Hold tight to this teaching as if it were a PR deadlift, my\r   son. Judge not the swole, for they are not only strong of arm... they are\r   pure of heart.'\r26 'If any of you doubt this teaching, you shall receive no spot from me or my\r   swole disciples on your day of failure.'"

If one speaks or acts with a weakmind, catabolism follows As the wheel follows the push of Conan. 2 Swolemind is the forerunner of all gains. All gains are led by swolemind, created by swolemind. If one lifts and completes reps with a swolemind, gains follow. As surely as one's shadow. 3 'He lunk alarm'd me, swolehated me, interrupted my rep' Harboring such thoughts keeps weakness alive. 4 'He lunk alarm'd me, swolehated me, interrupted my rep' Releasing such thoughts banishes the weakmind for all time. 5 Unswole does not eradicate unswole. Only by dedication to the path of iron is unswole dissolved. This law is ancient and sacred. 6 There are those who are aware That they are always facing death Knowing this, they put aside all weakmind 7 The one who lives for steady-state cardio Indulgent in eating Lazy, and lacking in energy The tempter Missedreps breaks, Just as the obese breaks a fail elliptical. 8 The one who lives swolemindfully, senses under control Careful yet willingful in eating, devout to the temple, energetic from PWO Cannot be overthrown by missed reps Just as the wind cannot shake the bark from a great oak tree. 9 The spud belt does not in itself Render one free from weakmind If the one who wears that belt Is lacking in self-discipline and honest reps He is unworthy of such a belt. 10 Only one who is free from weakmind, Well-disciplined, honest in reps, And endowed with swolemind Is worthy of the spudbelt. 11 Those who fail to distinguish The nonessential assistance work from the essential And the essential assistance work from the nonessential Will, in feeding on weakmind thoughts, Fail to attain the essential 12 On the other bicep, those who correctly perceive The assistance work as assistance work, Will, in feeding on swolemind thoughts, Attain the essential 13 As creatine pours through a slotted serving spoon So does weakmind penetrate the unswole 14 For the doer of unswole deeds there is only catabolism Here as well as hereafter In both states he experiences catabolism Seeing his own unswole acts. 15 For the doer of swole deeds there is rejoicing Here as well as hereafter Swole and more swole are his As he sees his own right action 16 The doer of unswole deeds reaps catabolism Here and hereafter In both states remembering, 'I have cardiobunnied' Not only here, but hereafter, he experiences more catabolism Because he has gone to a state of unswole 17 The doer of swole deeds reaps gains Here and hereafter In both states remembering 'I have walked the path of iron' And there is more swole Because he has gone to Brodin's state 18 A careless person Quoting much of the swolemind text, but not living it Cannot share the abundance of the swole life Just as the weakbrah, counting other people's reps Cannot taste the pump or refeed 19 Reciting a small portion of the swolemind text But putting it diligently into practice Letting go of weakmind, swolescrimination, and muscle confusion Revering in the truth with a swolemind And not clinging to missed reps, here or hereafter Brings the harvest of the life of gains."

However, there is one sin that Brodin himself is said to have never committed. And that is the sin of not re-racking thy plates thereafter thy discharge of kinetic energy is finished. It only makes swolely sense to use more of your energy to walk three steps to put thy holy iron back into thy resting place. Praise comes to all brodinists that follow this decree. Thus, you are saving other brociples the sacred time they have to worship the swolely Brodin, from the hardships thy might encounter when lesser swoles thwart our discovery of the holy iron we are looking for to lift. This path of disobeying the Holy Temple's rules does not make you swole, but obeying the swolosophy from the Book of Brodin: Swole of the Spirit will heal and protect you from this curse. One musn't fall victim of the Bellyal, and always remember thy holy rule of Brodin. May the Brodin be with you and bless all brodinists with maximum gains."
